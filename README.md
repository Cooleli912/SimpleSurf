# SimpleSurf
A web browser for windows, while, very simple, it is very reliable for privacy!

# Install/Download
Currently unavalible, I will update this readme when I publish the first build.

Development Status: 50%
Almost Fully Functional.

# Downsides?
- SimpleSurf is not based off of Chromium, so things may not work correctly.
- SimpleSurf isn't as advanced, more advanced features will be worked on after the first build goes public
- SimpleSurf isn't an 100% replacement for any browser yet.

# Good Things?
- SimpleSurf is not run by a large company or team, rather just one person. That being me.
- SimpleSurf does not steal data or anything alike.
- SimpleSurf is a non-profit project that will never have ads built-in to the browser.
- SimpleSurf is not based on chromium, so even though some things might not work correctly, it is more safe and private.
- SimpleSurf does not intend to be malicous in any way, if you find the browser malicous report to this Github page so I may temporarily take down builds and fix the executables.

SimpleSurf is not a trademarked or copyrighted name, so there could be legitimate products with the same name, but still, do not trust alternate download pages.
